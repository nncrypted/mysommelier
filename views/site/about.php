	<h2>History</h2>
	MySommelier was born from a personal need to manage my library of wine accumulated over many years.  As a private wine collector, after 
	you get beyond 30-40 bottles is difficult to remember off the top of your head how much of which variety/vintage/winemaker you may have 
	on hand.  <br><br>
	When I looked around, I found 2 types of apps available (web apps and phone apps).  There were several web applications that offered 
	to allow their registered users to manage their cellars.  In addition to all the advertising clutter, none of these sites had a good 
	user experience for actually entering your wine data.  They focused on data normalization (to support marketing and analysis) over usability.  
	They were clunky, hard to navigate and confused with all kinds of data that most of us just don't care about. I did find some very good 
	phone apps out there, but those with the best UI and features were phone-only.  There was no web browser interface.  At one point, I 
	sat down for several evenings and went through adding my inventory to the app one bottle at a time.  Then, after I had it all loaded, 
	I thought I'd like to see how many bottles of zinfandel I had.  Well, there were no "reports" nor was there and easy export option.
	The phone is a good way to manage 1 bottle at a time, but not a good device to manage your entire inventory.
	<br><br>
	This all got me to thinking:  What I'd really like is a web based wine cellar inventory management system that had an easy to use web 
	browser front end that I could access from anywhere AND a mobile application version that provided a subset of features that I wanted 
	to access "while on the road".  I looked around quite a bit and found nothing that really met my needs.
	<br><br>
	So enter MySommelier.  It's a pretty standard PHP/MySQL web application built on the YiiFramework v2.0.16 and includes RESTful interface.  
	With the YiiFramework, I've added 3 themes to support normal PC or laptop, tablet and mobile phone formats.  It's just 1 application with 
	auto device detection and themes to customize the view to the device.  Not all functionality is available in all views.
	<br><br>
	The RESTful interface provides a external interface opening access to your own cellar data and all the reference data. 
	<br><br>
	I've focused the mobile features around 3 primary use cases:
	<br><br>
	<h3>"I'm at my cellar, managing my wine inventory"</h3>
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
	<li>I'd like to quickly add, delete, increment or decrement a wine</li>
	<li>I'd like to know how many bottles I have, of what varietal and what region</li>
	<li>I'd like to add/delete/update wineries, regions, appellations and varietals</li>
	<li>I'd like to add/delete/update orders and record futures</li>
	<li>II'd like to add/delete/update users and user permissions</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>"I'm wine tasting at a winery"</h3>
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
	<li>I'd like to see what I have in my cellar</li>
	<li>I'd like to capture notes/comments about what I'm tasting tasting</li>
	<li>I'd like to take a few pictures (of wine and the winery) and attach them appropriately</li>
	<li>I'd like to add/delete/update orders and record futures</li>
	<li>I'd like to capture a purchase of a wine</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>"I'm at a store"</h3>

	<li>I'd like to view my orders and futures</li>
	<li>I'd like to capture a purchase of a wine</li>
	</ul>
